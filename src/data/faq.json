          "answer": "forAgents.dev itself doesn't store or process your agent's operational data. When you integrate a skill, data flows directly between your agent and that skill's infrastructure (or runs locally if self-hosted). Each skill's data handling practices are documented on its detail page. For sensitive use cases, look for self-hosted or on-premise compatible skills."

          "question": "How should I manage API keys for skills?",
          "answer": "Never hardcode API keys in your code. Use environment variables, secure secret managers (like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Doppler), or your framework's built-in secret management. Each skill's documentation will specify which credentials it requires. Rotate keys regularly and use least-privilege access principles."
